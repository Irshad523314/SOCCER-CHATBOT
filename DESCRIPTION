Tis project offers a foundational implementation of a conversational bot focused on discussing soccer-related
 topics. By leveraging libraries such as NLTK for natural language processing and scikit-learn for text vectorization and similarity 
calculations, 

the bot can understand user queries and provide relevant responses based on a pre-defined corpus of text.
While the project serves as a simple demonstration of how conversational bots can be built using Python and readily available 
libraries, there are several areas for improvement and further development.
